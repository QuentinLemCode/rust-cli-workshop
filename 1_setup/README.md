# Environnement Setup

## :dart: Objective 

Make your Rust setup environnement ready


## :pencil: Step 1 - Setup 

### Create a new application

```bash
cargo new crabby
```

> :bulb: Notes 
>
> Cargo create a git repository with all structure by default  
> use `cargo new --help` for more options

### How to build application


Launch `cargo`:

```bash
cargo build
```

Look at newly created directories and files: 

```bash
ls ./target/
```

You can execute file `./target/debug/crabby`Â 


Launch `cargo`:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

> You can add one more profiles


### How to run application


Launch `cargo`:

```bash
cargo run 
```

:question:  Look at executed file 

`Running 'target/debug/crabby'`




> :bulb: Notes

### How to test


Launch `cargo`:

```bash
cargo test 
```

:exclamation: No test are writtien yet...Coming soon

change the programm output with : 

```bash

## :clap: Congrats, you have a working Rust setup !
